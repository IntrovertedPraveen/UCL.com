                    <p class="mt-5">The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association
                        football
                        competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by
                        top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage
                        to
                        qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is the most-watched club
                        competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only
                        the UEFA
                        European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football
                        tournaments in
                        the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national
                        league
                        champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.</p>

                <h4 class="cl-history">History of The Champions League</h4>
                <p class="mt-5">The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the
                    1895
                    World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Hearts 5–3. The first
                    pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian
                    Empire.
                    Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the
                    only
                    existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten
                    Ponthoz, thus
                    being dubbed as the "club championship of the continent" by the local newspapers.
                </p>
                <p>The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of
                    Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.In 1930, the Coupe des Nations
                    (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was
                    played and organised by Swiss club Servette.Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from
                    across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.Latin European nations came
                    together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.</p>

                <h4 class="Begining">1955–1967: Beginnings</h4>
                <p class="mt-5">The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season. Sixteen teams participated
                    (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården
                    (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven
                    (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany),
                    Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó
                    (Hungary).</p>
                <p>The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting
                    CP and Partizan. The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of
                    Sporting CP. The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real
                    Madrid on 13 June 1956. The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from
                    Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial. Real Madrid successfully
                    defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.
                    After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians. In
                    1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to
                    equalise. The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the
                    game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.</p>

                <h4>1968–1982</h4>
                <p>The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup,
                    beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final. This final came ten years after the Munich air
                    disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby,
                    fighting for his life. In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European
                    Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino
                    Prati scoring a hat-trick.</p>

                <h4>1969–70</h4>
                <p>The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the
                    defending champions, Milan in the second round, before beating Celtic in the final. In the 1970–71
                    season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final. the season saw a number
                    of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that
                    it would be used in all rounds except the final. It was also the first time a Greek team reached the
                    final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La
                    Liga the previous season. Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973),
                    which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977
                    and 1978.</p>

                <p class="mt-5" id="pAnthem">The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as "Champions
                    League", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem
                    Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems). UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an
                    anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy
                    of St. Martin in the Fields. Stating that "the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy", UEFA's
                    official website adds it is "known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers
                    aflutter".</p>
                <p>The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French. The
                    climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The
                    Champions!'. The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams
                    are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In
                    addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself,
                    which is played as teams enter the field. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has
                    two short verses and the chorus.</p>
                <p>Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other
                    languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed
                    by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish;
                    Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza
                    (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019
                    finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by
                    2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).</p>

        <h4 class="assist" id="Assist">Most assists in UCL History</h4>
        <h5 class="ASSIST">10. Kevin De Bruyne – 28 assists </h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> One of only five players to notch over a hundred assists in the Premier League, De Bruyne has
            also stepped up on the big occasions in Europe.</p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> The Belgian finally got his hands on the trophy earlier this year. He’d played a starring
            role in Man City’s run, but he was forced to agonisingly watch on from the sidelines after suffering an
            injury against Inter in the final.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> =9. Thomas Muller – 29 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> Bayern Munich’s ‘Raumdeuter’ (space interpreter) is the epitome of consistency. Still going
            strong after 15 seasons with Bayern Munich, Muller has 29 assists to show for his stellar European career.
        </p>

        Perhaps his most memorable Champions League performance was when he starred in Bayern’s 8-2 demolition of
        Barcelona. Muller himself chipped in with three goal contributions on that famous night.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST">=9. Andres Iniesta – 29 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> The Spanish playmaker won all four of the Champions League finals he starred in. Iniesta
            defined a generation of Spanish football and is arguably the best midfielder of all time.</p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> The diminutive wizard was capable of dribbling around an entire team or killing you with a
            single pass. One of his last assists in the competition came in the 2014-15 final against Juventus to set up
            Ivan Rakitic for the opening goal.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> =9. Karim Benzema – 29 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> The French forward aged like a fine wine and only got better in his thirties. Benzema was
            often regarded as the third wheel behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, but his impact in Real Madrid’s
            2021-22 Champions League triumph cannot be underestimated.</p>

        He finally received the plaudits he deserved that year, going on to win the Ballon d’Or after his goalscoring
        heroics. But let’s not forget just how useful he was at playing provider for his world-class Los Blancos
        team-mates.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> =6. Xavi Hernandez – 30 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST">The Spanish maestro was the heartbeat of Barcelona for almost two decades and is now putting
            his supreme football intelligence to good use in the dugout.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> =6. Ryan Giggs – 30 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> The Welsh wizard had a career at Old Trafford which spanned from 1990-2014. Giggs expertly
            adapted his game over the years, but in his prime, he was like lightning in a bottle.</p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> A two-time Champions League winner with Manchester United, Giggs regularly produced the goods
            for United in Europe.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> 4. Neymar – 33 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> Neymar has had some truly remarkable individual campaigns in the Champions League. He played
            a pivotal role in Barcelona’s 2014-15 treble and he was PSG’s best player in 2020 when they made the final.
        </p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> The Brazilian plays with a samba flair that is a joy to watch each time he steps onto a
            football pitch. He’s the youngest player in this list and it’s a crying shame he’s currently out in Saudi
            Arabia with a long injury lay-off.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST">3. Angel Di Maria – 38 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> Like Neymar, Di Maria only got his hands on the Champions League trophy once, but he deserves
            a special place in the history of this competition.</p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> The Argentine winger was named as the UEFA Man of the Match in Real Madrid’s 2014 Champions
            League final triumph against Atletico Madrid. His left foot should be considered a lethal weapon.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST"> 2. Lionel Messi – 40 assists</h5>
        <p class="ASSIST"> Perhaps the best creator of all time, Messi has to settle for second place in the all-time
            European assisters. His Champions League CV is almost unparalleled with 129 goals and 40 assists to his
            name.</p>

        <p class="ASSIST"> His performance against Manchester United in the 2011 final is still regarded by many as the
            greatest Champions League final performance of all time. We still hope that he makes a shock return to
            Europe at some point.</p>

        <h5 class="ASSIST">1. Cristiano Ronaldo – 42 assists</h5>

        <p class="ASSIST"> Who else but CR7? While Ronaldo is best known for his goalscoring prowess, his creative
            numbers are also the best in the business.</p>

        <h1 id="Trophy">The UEFA Champions League Trophy</h1>

        <div class="card-img-overlay">
            <h5 class="card-title ms-2" id="TrophyTitle">The UCL Trophy</h5>
            <p class="card-text ms-2" id="TrophyText">The European Champion Clubs' Cup, also known as Coupe des Clubs
                Champions Européens, or simply the European Cup, is a trophy awarded annually by UEFA to the football
                club that wins the UEFA Champions League. The competition in its older format shared its name with the
                trophy, being also known as the European Cup, before being renamed for the 1992–93 season onwards.</p>
            <p class="ms-2" id="TrophyText">There have been several official incarnations of this trophy, as a club was
                entitled to keep the cup after five wins or three consecutive wins, with a new cup having to be forged
                for the following season. During the first years of the competition, up until 1966–67 season, the trophy
                had a distinctively different design.</p>

            <h5 id="TrophyTitle">The Original UCL Trophy</h5>
            <p class="ms-2" id="TrophyText">The original European Cup trophy was donated by L'Équipe, a French sports
                newspaper. This trophy was awarded permanently to Real Madrid in March 1967. At the time, they were the
                reigning champions, and had won six titles altogether, including the first five competitions from 1956
                to 1960. Celtic therefore became the first club to win the cup in its current design in 1967.</p>
